            <h1>Why Work With Us?</h1>
            <p> Outperforming ourselves is a rush. That’s why we perform with purpose. Together, we blaze new trails,
                succeed, celebrate and then do something even bigger. We never settle for second best. At Pepsi we’re
                not
                just committed to performing well as Individuals, but as a team, to strengthen the company as a
                whole.
            </p>
            <p>
                Around the world we’re
                working hard to give people the tastes they crave and the nutrition they need. We
                dream globally and act locally, constantly innovating to sustain our planet, our people, our communities
                and
                our business practices. Here at Pepsi Beverages North America every day is an adventure, and an
                opportunity
                for personal and professional growth.</p>

            <p>For decades, Pepsi has made our company better and more competitive by building a diverse, equitable, and
                inclusive space for our associates, business partners, and society. Through inclusive practices such as
                offering ongoing sign language training, enhanced disability benefits, and self-identification we are
                ensuring our associates have the tools they need to achieve their maximum potential. Through our work
                with our Employee Resource Group, EnAble, and the Pepsi ACT program, a partnership with Disability
                Solutions, our company has increased training for our leaders and managers as well as created
                opportunities for the employment of talent with disabilities.</p>
